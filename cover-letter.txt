I am proud of my achievements as a Technical Team Leader at Vonage (part of Ericsson), where I led the Conversation API Team and managed Client SDKs for JavaScript, Android, and iOS. This experience enhanced my leadership skills, allowing me to effectively guide a team while contributing hands-on to the development process.

My commitment to quality and innovation is evident in my diverse project portfolio, ranging from geolocated chat applications to interactive learning tools like JSQuest. I have also contributed to significant projects like the Vonage Conversation API, Client SDK JS, and various multichannel chat applications.

I am particularly drawn to the exciting challenges and innovative projects at [Company Name]. The opportunity to apply my skills in a collaborative and forward-thinking environment aligns perfectly with my career aspirations.
